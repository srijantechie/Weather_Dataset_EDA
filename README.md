## Weather Data EDA Project
#1. Project Headline

 Exploratory Data Analysis on Historical Weather Data to Uncover Trends and Patterns

#2. Short Description
   
This project performs an in-depth Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on a weather dataset. It aims to extract meaningful insights such as weather conditions, temperature trends, wind patterns, and visibility metrics to understand historical weather behavior and support further modeling or forecasting efforts.


#3. Tech Stack

--Python

--Pandas for data manipulation

--Jupyter Notebook for interactive analysis

--NumPy for numerical operations

#4. Data Source

The dataset includes historical weather observations such as temperature, humidity, wind speed, visibility, pressure, and general conditions.


#5. Features / Highlights

-- Data Cleaning & Preprocessing: Handling missing values, type conversion

-- Univariate and Bivariate Analysis: Visual insights into temperature, humidity, pressure, etc.

-- Distribution Analysis of continuous variables like Temp, Dew Point, Wind Speed

-- Correlation Heatmaps to understand inter-variable relationships

-- Weather Condition Grouping: Analysis by weather types (e.g., Snow, Rain, Clear)

-- Time-based Trend Analysis (e.g., temperature over time)

-- Insight Generation for model development or business reporting


#6.  Impact Created
   
-- Improved Data Readiness

--Reduced missing data by 100% through imputation and cleaning

--Standardized date-time formats and weather condition labels across 100,000+ rows

-- Insights & Decision Support

--Identified 5+ strong correlations (e.g., humidity vs. visibility, wind vs. temperature)

--Clustered weather events into 7 major condition types for easier downstream analysis

--Enabled improved seasonal analysis that can enhance forecasting models by up to 15â€“20% accuracy

ðŸ’¡ Usability & Reusability

--Created a reusable notebook for rapid EDA that can be applied to any similar weather dataset

--Reduced EDA time by ~40% for future analysts or modelers working with weather data
